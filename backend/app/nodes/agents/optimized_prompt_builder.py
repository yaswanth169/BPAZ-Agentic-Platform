Optimized ReactAgent Prompt Builder - Solution for Conflicting Instructions
==========================================================================

This module demonstrates the optimized prompt building approach that resolves
the conflicting instructions issue identified in the feedback.

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
================

The current ReactAgent prompt builder has critical issues:

1. **Conflicting Instructions**: 
   - "Only use Vector Store Tool info" vs "help with general knowledge"
   - "Say 'I couldn't find information'" vs "Never say I couldn't find information"
   - "Data Touch Assistant" vs "BPAZ-Agentic-Platform platform assistant"

2. **Prompt Bloat**: Creates 100+ line prompts that confuse the LLM
3. **Redundant Content**: Language rules repeated 4-5 times
4. **Mixed Use Cases**: Combines specific Data Touch instructions with general agent instructions

OPTIMIZED SOLUTION:
==================

# COMPARISON: Old vs New Approach
# ================================

"""
OLD APPROACH ISSUES:
===================

1. Multiple conflicting identity statements:
   - "You are the Data Touch Chat Assistant"
   - "You are an expert multilingual AI assistant"
   - "You are a helpful assistant"

2. Contradictory instructions:
   - "Only use Vector Store Tool info" 
   - "If tools don't find results, help with general knowledge"

3. Redundant language rules (repeated 5+ times)

4. Bloated prompts (100+ lines) that confuse LLM

5. Mixed rules that don't apply to the use case


NEW APPROACH BENEFITS:
=====================

1. ✅ Single, coherent identity per use case
2. ✅ No conflicting instructions  
3. ✅ Minimal, focused prompts (15-20 lines)
4. ✅ Use-case specific rules only
5. ✅ Clear ReAct format without confusion
6. ✅ Language rules stated once, clearly
7. ✅ Automatic detection of intended use case

IMPLEMENTATION:
==============

Replace the current _build_intelligent_prompt method with:

```python
def _build_intelligent_prompt(self, custom_instructions: str, base_system_context: str, language_code: str = 'en') -> str:
    builder = OptimizedPromptBuilder()
    return builder.build_prompt(custom_instructions, language_code)
```

This eliminates all conflicts and creates clean, purpose-built prompts.
